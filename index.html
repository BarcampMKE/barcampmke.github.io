        <h2>What is BarCamp?</h2>
        <p>
          Once there was this thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp" target="_blank">Foo Camp</a> -
          a gathering of the tech elites by special invite of Tim O'Reilly.  It was a pretty cool participant-driven event,
          but it was <em>invite only</em>. <strong class="accent">[Boo - hiss!]</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2005, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">someone</a> thought:
          <blockquote>
            Just because you weren't invited, doesn't mean you shouldn't get the benefit of an awesome gathering like this.
          </blockquote>
          So...
        </p>
        <p>
          BarCamp (as in foo<strong class="accent">bar</strong>) was born!  BarCamps are participant-driven technical events located all over
          the world (like Milwaukee).  These not-for-profit, inclusive events are open to anyone, invite or not! (Most
          require registration for planning purposes.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok - fine - cool - but what does participant-driven mean?  What actually <em>happens</em> at a BarCamp?
        </p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>What Happens @ BarCamp?</h2>
        <p class="accent">What happens at BarCamp <strong>does not</strong> stay at BarCamp!</p>
        <p>Since BarCamp is a participant-driven event, we can't say for certain what happens.  But, there are some generally predictable things that happen.</p>
        <p>In the morning, participants interested in presenting a topic should add their name and topic to an open spot in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_mV1XlMldoV0ee8kgOy85BM4F0NgO_yJvzrNwVG-LH4/edit#gid=0">schedule</a>.</p>
		<p>Then, before each presentation, everyone checks the schedule and attends a location/talk that they wish.</p>
        <p><strong class="accent">Didn't find any that you like?</strong>  That's ok - find a spot - grab some people - and make your own talk.  It can be a presentation, a round-table, a discussion or even a show-and-tell.</p>
        <p><strong>Bring your sleeping bag!</strong> Attendees are welcome to stay the night at the event location.</p>
