        <h2>What is BarCamp?</h2>
        <p>
          Once there was this thing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp" target="_blank">Foo Camp</a> -
          a gathering of the tech elites by special invite of Tim O'Reilly.  It was a pretty cool participant-driven event,
          but it was <em>invite only</em>. <strong class="accent">[Boo - hiss!]</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2005, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp">someone</a> thought:
          <blockquote>
            Just because you weren't invited, doesn't mean you shouldn't get the benefit of an awesome gathering like this.
          </blockquote>
          So...
        </p>
        <p>
          BarCamp (as in foo<strong class="accent">bar</strong>) was born!  BarCamps are participant-driven technical events located all over
          the world (like Milwaukee).  These not-for-profit, inclusive events are open to anyone, invite or not! (Most
          require registration for planning purposes.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok - fine - cool - but what does participant-driven mean?  What <em>happens</em> at a BarCamp?
